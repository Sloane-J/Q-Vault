Paper Management System Implementation Plan
1. Database Structure
First, we need to create the database models and relationships:

Papers Table: Core table storing paper information
Metadata Tables: For categories like departments, courses, levels, exam types
Version Control Table: To track paper revisions
Download Logs Table: For tracking paper downloads

2. Model Creation
Create these Eloquent models with their relationships:

Paper - Main model for exam papers
Department - For departmental categorization
Course - For course-specific papers
ExamType - (Final, Resit, etc.)
StudentType - (HND, B-Tech, Top-up)
PaperVersion - For version control of updated papers
DownloadLog - For tracking downloads

3. File Storage Configuration

Configure Laravel's file storage system
Set up appropriate disk configurations (local/cloud)
Create storage directories with proper permissions
Define access rules for different file types

4. Controllers & Livewire Components

Create a PaperController for backend operations
Develop Livewire components for interactive features:

UploadPaper component
PapersList component with filtering
PaperVersion component for version management
PaperPreview component for PDF viewing


5. Interface Development

Admin paper upload form with all metadata fields
Paper listing interface with filters
Version history view
PDF preview interface

6. Business Logic Implementation

File validation (file type, size limits)
Metadata validation and processing
Version control logic
PDF processing (preview generation)
Search indexing

7. Security Measures

File access permissions
User role verification for operations
Secure download links

Detailed First Steps
To begin implementation today, here's what I recommend:

Create the database migrations for the paper system
Build the Eloquent models with relationships
Configure the file storage system
Create the basic Livewire components for paper management
Implement the paper upload functionality with metadata
